 overnight locations, and maintenance facilities staffed by technicians who understand that the transportation we provide is critically important to our customers.</p>

<h1>FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS<h1>

<p>The first thing you should know about our truckload solutions is that we have more than 2,900 tractors and 8,000 trailers in our truckload freight
 fleet. But as you learn more, you’ll see that capacity — while critical — is not the sole advantage of using XPO's truckload carrier operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Proactive Technology — We take pride in solving most problems before they start. For example, if storms are forecast on a route, our technology alerts our fleet managers, dynamically rerouting our truckload drivers. We do everything possible to avoid delays – including rescheduling pickups to ensure on-time delivery.</li>

	<li>High Visibility — Our centralized operations are effective in streamlining the transport process, from monitoring loads to communicating with customers as frequently as necessary. You can also monitor your own loads by using the online customer tools we’ll provide to you.</li>

	<li>Reliable Capacity — We support our truckload network of more than 2,900 drivers with secure, overnight terminal locations and professional maintenance facilities. There resources reinforce our ability to pick up and deliver on time.</li>

	<li>Premier drivers — Only three out of every 100 applicants, on average, make the cut to driver for our truckload business. Safe, quality professional drivers are essential, and our goal is to make sure customers work only with the best of the best.</li>

	<li>Integrated solutions — We work with companies of all sizes to help them run their supply chains more efficiently, and at lower cost, by utilizing multiple supply chain solutions through XPO. Monitor your loads through the Customer Connection at TL.xpo.com for all your web tool needs.</li>

 Our transportation management system (TMS) options include extensive carrier management capabilities, logistics systems tailored to your requirements
 and the largest web-based expedite bid system in North America. These solutions can be extremely effective in improving efficiency and reducing costs.</p>

<p>The keys to optimizing your supply chain may be hiding in plain sight. We’ll bring a new perspective to the process and show you where the opportunities lie.</p>

<h1>CARRIER MANAGEMENT</h1>

<p>XPO’s carrier management programs are designed to reduce your transportation costs and overall risk through collaborative relationships. We’ll spend the time
to thoroughly understand your business then create a detailed plan for sustainable improvements:</p>

<p>Capacity management — We’ll leverage our brokered and owned capacity pools to provide solutions that range from dedicated and static routings to ad-hoc and dynamic routings across all modes</p>

<p>Vetted sourcing — Tell us what’s important to you and we’ll build that criteria into the plan: safety, flexibility, responsiveness, cost competitiveness, eco-friendly (SmartWay) or any other priorities you set</p>

<p>Risk management — Master cargo contracting and management of insurance certificate compliance are just two of the many ways we can reduce your risk</p>

<p>Request for quote (bid) — We can conduct large-scale formal bids or small ad-hoc bids using our carriers, your carriers or a combination of both — followed by analysis, awards and on-boarding</p>

<p>Performance management — We’ll use our proprietary technology to develop KPIs and other metrics that can drive continuous improvement and root cause analysis</p>

<p>Market analysis — We use big data to anticipate trends and incorporate this information into strategic planning for future period</p>

Web-based Expedite TMS

SERVICES/TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT/   (Bread crum)
<h1>WEB-BASED EXPEDITE TMS</h1>

<p>XPO is the largest provider of web-based expedite transportation management in North America. Our robust TMS technology captures and broadcasts shipment requirements within minutes 
of receiving an automated or manual order entry. Load assignment, GPS and cellular track and trace, proof of delivery, detailed invoicing and reporting are all executed by our proprietary
 software. To begin using XPO's online expedite auctions, call (800) 800-5161.</p>

<p>We’re also incredibly fast. Our system can access over 700 qualified carriers in minutes to keep facilities operating in the face of supply chain disruptions. A full 99% of the
 shipments we managed in 2014 were sourced in less than 24 minutes. This level of responsiveness has been built into our technology over more than 20 years of continuous development.
 The speed, accuracy and flexibility of our applications are key reasons why many of the world’s most exacting shippers think of us first for expedite.</p>

<p>We’re also responsive when it comes to cost effectiveness. When we spot repetitive freight patterns, we can often be proactive in negotiating set rates. And when any shipment is 
entered for bid, our system not only selects the optimal mode (ground, air freight or air charter) but also selects the optimal vehicle size. The carrier who accepts the load will only
be paid for the specified equipment, even if he enters a higher rate based on a different kind of vehicle. These are just two examples of how our software design is strongly customer-centric.</p>

<p>Most important are our data and our people. Any field that requires completion at the time of order entry is reportable data. We can report on origins, destinations, carriers and many 
other actionable points, including event and exception management in real-time. Time-critical shipments have our experienced eyes on them at all times – from bidding to booking to transit 
and delivery, and finally through data analysis.</p>

YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN/ SERVICE BEYOND PERFORMANCE  (bread crumb)

<h>Expect More Than Performance From Your 3PL</h1>

<p>As crucial as on-time deliveries and accurate fulfillment are to your supply chain, they don’t necessarily separate one 3PL from another.</p>

<p>What makes a 3PL stand apart is whether they grasp your vision and can engineer a strategy to bring it to life. Whether they’re committed to creating value in your supply chain — and instilling trust and confidence in you. That’s what separates partners from providers.</p>

<p>When you collaborate with a 3PL, you allow them a privileged opportunity to improve your business-critical operations. When they do their job well and completely, they’ll reward your trust by proving themselves the sort of strategic partner you’ll value for the long haul.</p>

<h3>Service Beyond Performance Sets Landair Apart</h3>

<p>While other 3PLs want to win your business, Landair also wants to earn your trust. To collaborate with you on something truly remarkable: A supply chain that moves you forward — your business, your customer relationships, and your reputation as a supply chain leader and innovator.</p>

<p>We strive to become your 3PL partner for the long term by consistently providing service beyond performance in three key aspects of our relationship:</p>

<ul>
	<li><bold>Communication:</bold> We stay in touch with you, consistently and with candor, regarding day-to-day operations, including any unexpected disruptions or delays. And we’ll come to you often with ideas for improvement.</li>

	<li><bold>Responsiveness:</bold> We mold our services and strategies to fit your vision and operations. When necessary, we recover and problem-solve proactively, whether the source of a problem is man-made or nature’s doing.</li>

	<li><bold>Added value:<bold> Our goal is to help you discover value, reduce costs and enhance customer service in significant, measureable ways. In fact, we seek opportunities for Guaranteed Value Acceleration in the logistics strategies we engineer and implement in collaboration with you.</li>

<p>When supply chain managers tell us we don’t act or sound like other 3PLs, we take it as validation for how we think, operate and work with our customers. Because at Landair our aim isn’t to be just another 3PL. It’s to be your 3PL.</p>

YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN/ ENGINEERING  (bread crumb)

Maybe for the Landing Page...


<h1>Engineering Your Logistics Strategy</h1>

<p>As a supply chain professional you make it your business to find new ways to improve operations and customer service. Sometimes achieving that next, higher level of performance takes expertise and design tools that aren’t available internally.</p>

<p>When you turn to a 3PL for support, you’re looking for close collaboration, not a cookie-cutter solution. Yet some 3PLs take a very rigid and laborious approach to analysis and design. An approach that seems driven more by their process requirements than by yours.</p>

<p>If that experience has been frustrating for you, then you might prefer a 3PL that takes a more agile approach to supply chain consulting. A partner that drills to the core of your particular challenge or opportunity with you, then shifts promptly into strategy design, operations planning and implementation mode.</p>

<h3>From Analysis to Action, We Focus on Your Business</h3>

<p>Landair’s supply chain engineers combine analysis and action in the proportions today’s supply chain managers need. We start with laser focus on creating innovation and value at the heart of your U.S. supply chain. Then we drive toward logistics strategies that include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Transportation management</li>
	<li>Distribution center management</li>
	<li>Dedicated contract carriage</li>
	<li>Dedicated contract carriage</li>
</ul>

<p>Our engineers get hands-on to analyze your current operations and performance metrics, but stop well short of burying you in spreadsheets and questionnaires. Problem-solving experience helps them map value streams, identify process shortcomings and conduct scenario modeling — all the while keeping the data gathering and documentation required of you to a minimum.</p>

YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN/ TECHNOLOGY  (bread crumb)

<p>When you work with a 3PL to help manage your supply chain, you should expect that provider to be up to speed on logistics technology.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need a 3PL flexible enough to adapt to your needs, not one who rigidly insists on an all-or-nothing “solution,” dependent on costly, complex-to-integrate software.</p>

<p>With 30-plus years in transportation and logistics, Landair has a sense for where you need a 3PL partner to focus, yet also be flexible, in making technology work smarter for you — instead of you having a tough time with technology.</p>

<h3>Engineering Your Logistics Strategy</p>

<p>You’re ready to partner with a 3PL to improve your supply chain. But you need a strategy soon, not one that requires months or even years of costly, time-consuming engineering analysis and systems integration.</p>

<p>Whether it’s for <link>dedicated contract carriage</link>, <link>distribution center management</link> or <link>transportation management</link>, the lion’s share of your logistics strategy from Landair springs from the insights of our engineers, not from a computer algorithm.</p>

<p>At the same time, they go to work armed with advanced analysis and design tools. They use these tools, along with experience and know-how, to quickly study distribution management workflows and conduct transportation network modeling.</p>

<p>The benefit to you is our ability to explore and validate alternative strategies efficiently on the drawing board, so the best one performs as expected in your supply chain.</p>


<h3>Managing and Improving Operations</h3>

<p>From optimizing loads and lanes to streamlining fulfillment, Landair routinely employs a suite of logistics management technologies to keep your operations running smoothly and performance metrics climbing. Those include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <link>transportation management system</link> (TMS) widely acknowledged as one of the industry’s most advanced and flexible.</li>

	<li>A robust <link>warehouse management system</link> (WMS) that empowers us to manage distribution to high levels of accuracy, efficiency and continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solving for Visibility, Safety and Sustainability</h3>

<p>All the technology in the world isn’t worth much if you lack visibility into supply chain performance. From status updates via on-board Qualcomm units to our proprietary track-and-trace technologies, Landair integrates the right systems so you can track shipments online 24/7 and get the performance metrics and analysis you need.</p>

<p>We also make extensive use of technology tools, including driver e-logs and fuel optimization software, to ensure our drivers and equipment are meeting rigorous standards on everything from miles per gallon to hours of service.</p>

<p>In other words, we leverage technology to ensure that Landair is, and will remain, a safe, value-adding, cost-effective logistics partner you can rely on.</p>

YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN/ SAFETY  (bread crumb)

<H1>Mitigate Risk by Demanding Safety From Your 3PL Partners<h1>

<p>Worker and workplace safety are subjects of intense focus and concern among today’s supply chain leaders and corporate risk managers. And nowhere is the safety spotlight — within your operations, among your logistics providers — shining more intensely than on freight transportation and warehouse operations.</p>

<p>While the percentage of accidents involving heavy trucks remains just a fraction of total motor vehicle accidents, recent court rulings and vicarious liability laws have shippers concerned over potential risks posed by trucking accidents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, FreightWatch International reports that incidents of cargo theft reached a record high in the United States in 2012, with more than 80 percent of those thefts involving full-truckload or container cargo.</p>

<p>As a supply chain manager or procurement professional, you need freight carriers and logistics partners who demonstrate both a track record and an unwavering commitment when it comes to safety. In short, you need 3PL partners you can trust.</p>

<h3>Striving to Be Among the Safest 3PLs<h3>

<p>At Landair we strive to rank among the industry’s safest transportation and logistics providers by ingraining safety in our culture. After all, if you absolutely rely on transportation safety, warehouse safety and cargo security within your supply chain, then it’s something we’re absolutely in business to deliver.</p>

<p>Landair’s commitment to your risk mitigation begins with screening and training our employees for safety awareness and performance. Our drivers must have at least one year of over-the-road experience to be considered. We thoroughly check each driver’s background, driving record, employment history and references.</p>

<p>Our commitment to safety continues with safety training and testing during new-hire orientation. It extends via companywide safety awareness messages, plus on-site driver and distribution center workshops, led by experienced and knowledgeable safety managers.</p>

<p>Our safety commitment grows because we apply the same process discipline to it that we bring to finding continuous improvement in your logistics operations. Identify and measure potential issues and opportunities. Get at root causes. Implement training, technology and process improvements.</p>

<h3>Taking the Measure of Logistics Safety<h3>

<p>Inside your distribution centers, on the loading docks, on the road delivering your freight, you’ll know that you’re being served by Landair employees who’ve been screened and are continuously trained and mentored for safety.</p>

<p>It’s why, over 30-plus years in business, Landair’s recordable injury record has been consistently low. How we’ve consistently maintained the U.S. Department of Transportation’s top ranking for carrier safety. And why you’ll find our Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) scores not only strong within our carrier peer group, but showing a pattern of continuous improvement since 2010, when the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) scoring system began.</p>

YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN/ SUSTAINABILITY  (bread crumb)

<h1>Striving for Environmental Sustainability<h1>

When considering a 3PL as your supply chain partner, you want to know if you share the same values. Not just the business value of supply chain efficiency for better ROI. But the human value of social responsibility for a better world.

If you value treating the earth’s environment and resources with respect and care, know that Landair is focused on being a thoughtful environmental steward, both in our operations and in the logistics services we provide for customers.

Reducing Fuel Consumption and Emissions

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, all types of transportation — consumers, agricultural, commercial — combined account for nearly half of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. Landair is committed to doing our part to change that growth curve.

Many factors play a role, from engine speed and idle mode to the volume and type of freight being transported. As a certified SmartWay® transportation partner since 2008, we work to reduce fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions by:

<list>
Applying advanced transportation software tools to drive route optimization, fuel conservation and engine efficiency.
Adjusting the speed governors on our trucks to a maximum 62 miles per hour, for greater fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.
Specifying, purchasing and operating a modern, fuel-efficient, aerodynamically advanced truck fleet, while also upgrading our forklift fleet to the newest, toughest emissions standards.
Training and monitoring our drivers to reduce the time their trucks spend idling, while also using cab heaters and idle-control technologies to ensure we meet government “smart idle” standards.
Recycling all waste oil and tires.
Employing electronic logs instead of paper to record driver activities.
</list>


Eliminating and Recycling Waste

Reducing fuel consumption and emissions isn’t the only way Landair works to minimize impact on the environment. We’ve also implemented recycling of paper, plastic, wooden pallets and cardboard at all the distribution centers we manage for customers.

Each month truckloads of plastic and paper at Landair-managed warehouses get diverted from the waste stream and recycled into productive re-use applications. We’ve also installed energy-efficient lighting fixtures at both our managed facilities and our headquarters.

With each new distribution management engagement, Landair engineers and operations managers work with you to understand your brand’s sustainability philosophy and policies. Then, integral to your logistics contract and strategy, we’ll implement the necessary management oversight, process flows and equipment to ensure the facility meets or exceeds your standards for everything from materials recycling to managing rainwater runoff.

If respect and care for the environment are concerns for your organization, know that it’s a value Landair shares with you.
